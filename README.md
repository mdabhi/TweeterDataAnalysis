# TweeterDataAnalysis
Import the data using Tweeter API and perform the analysis to generate the data insights of tweets posted in last 1 month.

The main purpose of this project is to import the data using Tweeter API, perform data cleaning and generate the insights about the tweets posted and likes, comments received on the posted tweets in last 1 year.

- Step1: Create an account or use the existing account to generate authentication key and tokens for Tweeter API
- Step2: Save the keys and tokens as variables.
  consumer_key = "xxxxxx"
  consumer_secret = "xxxxxx"
  access_token = "xxxxxx"
  access_token_secret = "xxxxxxx"
- Step3: Pass in the parameters to Tweepy API
- Step4: Initiate the Tweepy API
- Step5: Create search query with number of tweets and filter words
- Run the search quesry with Tweepy API

Result:
The search results were not generated as there is no more access to data with free account. All the data can be accessed using only paid account.

Learning: 
Ensure the API can be accessed with free acoount in the beginning of the project always.
